**PxSemantic** provides an extrem dynamic and highly customizable solution to embed structured data on your website
and enrich them with information about your website. The currently supported classes are a subset of the vocabulary
defined on https://schema.org/ and were generated with the schema generator from https://api-platform.com/. At the
moment we only support `json-ld <http://json-ld.org/>`_ format to encode LinkedData.

More information to structured data you can get here https://developers.google.com/structured-data/.
